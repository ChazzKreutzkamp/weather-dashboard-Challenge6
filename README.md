# Weather Dashboard

This Application helps the user plan for vacations by giving them the current weather forcast, as well as a five day forcast.
This is achieved by asking the user to input a city into an input form, and after submitting the city the two areas update,
these being an area for the current forcast and a second area that gives a five-day forcast on five cards displaying the
temperature, weather via an image, and humidity. In the current forcast area the weather is depicted as an image, the 
temperature is given in Farenhiet, Humidity is displayed, the Wind Speed in MPH is given, and the UV index is displayed.
However, this isn't the only functionality of the application, as it also saves previous searches into generated buttons,
that can be clicked to redisplay the weather for the previous search, and these searches are also saved to the Local
Storage, where they are re-initialized upon a screen refresh, and the starting initialized screen will default to their
previous search (if there are no searches in the local history, the default weather being displayed is for New York City).
